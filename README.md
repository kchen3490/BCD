# BCD
Binary Coded Decimal class to overcome the limits of Java's Integer class (e.g., 2^31 - 1 is the Integer class's max).

This assignment was my first long-term Java program to be completed over a couple of weeks. It was assigned by my high school teacher in early 2021, when I first learned the principles of Java.

You may have permission to use this code as long as you do not plagarize it for, including but not limited to, a computer science project in an academic setting. In this case, teachers and professors want to see what you're capable of, so please don't plagarize and enjoy the learning process of programming :)
